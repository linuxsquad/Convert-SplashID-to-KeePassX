Convert SplashID DB (v3) into keepassX (keepassx.org) and keePass (keepass.info)

These python scripts can be used to migrate account database from SplashID software into either 
keePassX or keePass. They confusingly have identical names and share UI resemblance, but these 
are two differnt programs. keePassX is mostly used on Linux, while keePass dominates 
MS Windows, iOS and Android share.

The scripts will take SplashID exported database (in native VID format) and convert it into 
keePassX or keePass XML files, that later can be imported to one of the program.

ASSUMPTION:
  * keePassX <Last Access> and <Last Modified> time stamp filled with a date and time of conversion
  * SplashID <Description> and <Company> fields merge into keePassX <title>
  * All SplashID fields that does not match main keePassX ones, added to the keePassX <comments>
  * All SplashID fields that does not match main keePass ones, added to the keePass <notes>
  * SplashID Creation Date is expected in the following format <November 28, 2009>
  
TODO:
  * Some characters have to be replaced (for instance, &) since keePassX refuses to import them
  * If SplashID has no username, check <comment> section for <account> data to substitute

=================

From SplashID website:
 You may also import and export SplashID records in CSV format.
 CSV stands for Comma Separated Values, and is a common file format
 readable by most spreadsheets, databases and word processors.
 If you wish to import a CSV file, the data must be in the following format:

    Type, Field 1, Field 2, Field 3, Field 4, Field 5, Field 6, Field 7, Field 8, Field 9, Date Modified, Notes, Category

 It is easy to create the above format in Excel by creating a spreadsheet
 with 13 columns (as designated above) with one record per row.
 Then save the splashid_export_f in CSV format.

 Note: When importing data, if the type field is blank the record
 will be placed in Unfiled. If there is a type name and it
 does not match an existing type a new type will be created.
